👨🏽‍💻 I am currently working as a data scientist at [Navi Technologies](https://navi.com) in Bengaluru, India.

🎓 I graduated top of my major from IIT Kharagpur with dual degree (B. Tech. + M. Tech.). I  earned my Bachelor's degree from the [Department of Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.iitkgp.ac.in), where I pursued my B.Tech. in Instrumentation Engineering. I attained my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning & Applications from the [Centre of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence (CoEAI)](http://www.ai.iitkgp.ac.in) also at IIT Kharagpur.

🔬 My research interests lies in Computer Vision and its applications in healthcare and autonomous driving. Recently, I have also been exploring Natural Language Processing.
